                In this study, we aim to evaluate the quality of automatically synthesized tasks and their solution
                codes for the category of XLogo Mini. We have picked 30 reference tasks and synthesized 6 tasks for each of them. We would like to survey the quality of each of these synthesized tasks compared to their reference task.
            </p>
            <p>
                The survey has <strong>3 steps</strong> and they are described below.

            <h2>Step 1: Check Reference Task/Code</h2>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>We present one of the reference tasks and its solution code on the left panel of the page. The task
                    is presented below the “<strong> Reference Task</strong>” header and its solution code is presented under the
                    “<strong>Reference Code</strong>” header. Carefully view the task and its solution code.

            <h2>Step 3: Finish the Survey Questions</h2>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>You are provided with a <strong>google sheet</strong> with the survey questions to be answered for each synthesized task. Each row in the sheet corresponds to a specific synthesized
                    task. For each task, we present 6 questions. For each question, the rating can be picked from the given dropdown menu in each cell of the google sheet.
                </p>
                <p>Here are the questions:</p>

                <h3>Q1: Overall rating of the synthesized task</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (<strong>Poor</strong> quality, task cannot be solved or is very confusing, a teacher won't present this task to students)</li>
                    <li>0 (<strong>Satisfactory</strong> quality, a teacher would present this task to students with some modifications)
                    </li>
                    <li>1 (<strong>Excellent</strong> quality, a teacher can present this task to students without any adjustments)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q2: Difficulty of the synthesized task w.r.t reference task</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (<strong>Easier</strong> than the reference task)</li>
                    <li>0 (<strong>Similar </strong> difficulty to the reference task)</li>
                    <li>1 (<strong>More difficult</strong> than the reference task)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q3: Rating of the synthesized task in terms of concepts covered (e.g., shapes, colors, code structure, etc.) w.r.t. the reference task</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (<strong>Misses many</strong> important or relevant concepts that are essential)</li>
                    <li>0 (Contains <strong>a few unnecessary</strong> or irrelevant concepts that are not included in the reference
                        task.)</li>
                    <li>1 (Includes the <strong>same concepts</strong> as the reference task, or contains additional <strong>necessary</strong> concepts)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q4: If there are distractors in the synthesized task (e.g., walls, forbidden objects/grids), are they useful?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are no distractors</li>
                    <li>-1 (<strong>Not useful</strong>, all the distractors are not helpful for achieving the learning objectives)</li>
                    <li>0 (<strong>Partially useful</strong>, some distractors are useful while others may not be useful.)</li>
                    <li>1 (<strong>Very useful</strong>, all distractors are essential for achieving the learning objectives)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q5: Rating of synthesized code w.r.t reference code</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (<strong>Poor</strong> quality, synthesized code cannot solve the task, or violates the constraints in the task description)</li>
                    <li>0 (<strong>Acceptable</strong> quality, the synthesized code can solve the task and satisfies the code constraints (if any), but contains unnecessary commands)</li>
                    <li>1 (<strong>Good</strong> quality, the synthesized code can solve the task, satisfies the code constraints (if any) and doesn't include any unnecessary commands.)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>1. Please make sure that the task id (e.g., task18.p5) on the webpage matches the task id on the
                    google sheet, while filling in the survey for a specific task.</p>
                <p>
                    2. It would be more convenient to keep two pages open
                    side-by-side: the
                    <strong>webpage</strong> which describes each task and the <strong>google sheet</strong> to enter
                    the rating for the task.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. For each synthesized task, it typically takes <strong>3-5 minutes</strong> to complete these three steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Kindly provide your <strong>"Overall Comments"</strong> in the google sheet (last column). Your comments will be valuable for us.
