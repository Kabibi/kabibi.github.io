                In this study, we aim to evaluate the quality of automatically synthesized tasks and their solution
                codes for
                the category of XLogo Mini. We have picked 30 reference tasks from the XLogo Mini platform and
                synthesized 6 tasks for each of them. We would like to survey the quality of each of these synthesized
                tasks
                compared
                to their reference task.

            <p>
                The survey has 3 steps and they are described below.

                    is presented below the “Reference Task” header and its solution code is presented under the
                    “Reference Code” header. Carefully view the task and its solution code.

            <div class="panel">
                <p>You are provided with a google sheet ($NAME_expertFeedback_$DATE.xlxs) with the survey questions to
                    be answered for each synthesized task. Each row in the sheet corresponds to a specific synthesized
                    task. For each task, we present 6 questions. These questions must be answered on a 3-point Likert
                    scale. The rating can be picked from the given dropdown menu in each cell of the google sheet. 
                </p>
                <p>We describe each question below.</p>

                <h3>Q1: Overall rating of the synthesized task</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (Poor quality, task does not meet the stated requirements and expectations)</li>
                    <li>0 (Satisfactory quality, task meets the minimum requirements, but not adequate for students)
                    </li>
                    <li>1 (Excellent quality, task meets or exceeds all expectations and requirements)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q2: Difficulty of the synthesized task w.r.t reference task</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (Easier than the reference task)</li>
                    <li>0 (Similar difficulty to the reference task)</li>
                    <li>1 (More difficult than the reference task)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q3: Rating of synthesized tasks in terms of concepts covered</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (Misses many important or relevant concepts that are essential)</li>
                    <li>0 (Contains a few unnecessary or irrelevant concepts that are not included in the reference
                        task.)</li>
                    <li>1 (The concepts are the same as the reference task)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q4: If there are distractors (e.g., walls, forbidden objects/grids), are they useful?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (Not useful, all the distractors are not helpful for achieving the learning objectives)</li>
                    <li>0 (Partially useful, some distractors are useful while others may not be useful.)</li>
                    <li>1 (Very useful, all distractors are essential for achieving the learning objectives)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Q5: Rating of synthesized code w.r.t reference code</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>-1 (Poor quality, synthesized code has many redundant commands and is very confusing)</li>
                    <li>0 (Acceptable quality, The synthesized code meets the basic requirement, but may contain a few
                        unnecessary or irrelevant commands that could be removed to improve its quality.)</li>
                    <li>1 (Good quality, the synthesized code includes all necessary commands without any irrelevant
                        ones.)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Guidelines</h2>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>1. Please make sure that the task id (e.g., task18.p5) on the webpage matches the task id on the
                    google sheet, while filling in the survey for a specific task.</p>
                <p>
                    2. It would be more convenient to keep two pages open
                    side-by-side: the
                    <strong>webpage</strong> which describes each task and the <strong>google sheet</strong> to enter
                    the rating for the task.
